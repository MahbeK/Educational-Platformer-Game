            <h2>Welcome to Simple Platformer</h2>
            <p>I am a student studying at Bedfordshire University, and I am working on this game as my end-of-year project. The reason I chose to develop this game is to apply the knowledge I've gained in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over the years.</p>
            <p>The game I'm creating aims to provide educational benefits to young primary school kids. By incorporating fun gameplay elements, it offers a engaging way for children to enhance their studies while having fun.</p>
